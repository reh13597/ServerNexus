# Server Nexus
This is a website for people that need information about Minecraft servers such as the live status, player count, required version, metadata, and more. 
Users can create an account to fetch the data of any server, browse through popular servers, save their favorite servers, and leave ratings/reviews on servers.

# Note
This website is still a work in progress.
