    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">I (Alex) built this website with the purpose of addressing some issues I often run into when dealing with information about Minecraft servers.</p>
    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">1. Most websites that have Minecraft server information are not very intuitive or reliable.</p>
    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">2. There are no websites where people can save their favorite servers or rate them.</p>
    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">3. There are also no websites that offer the option to see other people's profiles, with their favorite servers and ratings listed.</p>
    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">Because of these 3 main issues, I decided to take matters into my own hands and here we are now! As an avid Minecraft fan and programmer, I wanted to express my passion for it in code. This website is still a work in progress, so there will be much more to come!</p>
    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">Have fun and enjoy!</p>
