# Server Nexus
Made using Svelte, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI, and Supabase.

This is a full-stack website for people that need information about Minecraft servers such as the live status, player count, required version, metadata, and more.
Users can create an account to fetch the data of any server, browse through popular servers, save their favorite servers, leave ratings/reviews on servers, and view user profiles.

# Note
This website is still a work in progress.
