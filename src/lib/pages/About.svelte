    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">I (Alex) built this website with the purpose of addressing some issues I often ran into when dealing with information about Minecraft servers.</p>
    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">1. Most websites that had Minecraft server information were not very intuitive or reliable.</p>
    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">2. There were no websites where people could save their favorite servers or advertise their own.</p>
    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">3. There were also no websites that offered server world maps, player stats & achievements, and live server chat feeds, all in one place.</p>
    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">Because of these 3 main issues, I decided to take matters into my own hands and here we are now! As an avid Minecraft fan and programmer, I wanted to express my passion for it in code. This website is still a work in progress, so there will be much more to come!</p>
    <p class="text-xl mt-10 text-balance">Have fun and enjoy!</p>
