        <p>Hey there! I'm <a aria-label="Alex's Portfolio Link" href="https://guoalex.com" target="_blank" class="text-green-500 hover:underline">Alex</a>,
            a Computer Science student at <a aria-label="SFU Link" href="https://www.sfu.ca/fas/computing.html" target="_blank" class="text-red-600 hover:underline">SFU</a>.</p>
        <p>I built this website with the purpose of addressing some issues I often run into when dealing with information about Minecraft servers.</p>
        <p><span class="text-primary">1.</span> Most websites that have Minecraft server information are not very intuitive or reliable.</p>
        <p><span class="text-primary">2.</span> There aren't many websites where people can save their favorite servers or leave reviews/ratings on them.</p>
        <p><span class="text-primary">3.</span> There also aren't many websites that offer the option to see other people's profiles, with their favorite servers and reviews/ratings listed.</p>
        <p>Because of these 3 main issues, I decided to take matters into my own hands and here we are now! As an avid Minecraft fan and programmer, I wanted to express my passion for it in code.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">Have fun and enjoy!</p>
        <p class="mt-3"><span class="text-primary">Note:</span> <br>This website is still a work in progress, but there is more to come!</p>
